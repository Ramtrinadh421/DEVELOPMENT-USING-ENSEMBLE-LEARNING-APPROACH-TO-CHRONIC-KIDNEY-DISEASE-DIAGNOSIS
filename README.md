# DEVELOPMENT USING ENSEMBLE LEARNING APPROACH TO CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE DIAGNOSIS

## Overview

This project implements machine learning techniques to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using ensemble learning methods. By leveraging multiple classification algorithms, it aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist in early detection of CKD.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Feature selection  
  - Addressing class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  - Random Forest  
  - XGBoost  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Predictive Analysis**  
  Generates CKD predictions based on optimized models.

- **Performance Metrics**  
  Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

- **Visualization**  
  - Feature importance plots  
  - Confusion matrix  
  - ROC curves

- **Deployment Ready**  
  Modular and well-structured for integration into clinical applications.
